# Python-Basic-Level
StartonEDU Python Course Assignment and Course Code Assemble for Level 1 and Level 2

## Try me
When you first look at this project, you should realize how neat it is to organize our code. The thing you should do first is to try to pull the whole repository from me.

## How to turned in?
When you finish the homework or when you have a finished homework somebody provided to you (of course, it is not encouraged), you need to turn "your" work back to my github repo. I will review your code and give the feedback for your homework. (some homework will be graded by my auto grader so you would only receive a score from it.)

## How to contact me?
You can call me if you have my cell phone number. If not, please write any homework related questions to startonedu003@gmail.com

If you have github questions, you can check this website for learning: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world

If you have tuition fee or register questions, please contact our frontdesk or send mail to startonedu001@gmail.com

I want to show you how to edit in the class.
